Welcome to my machine learning projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects I've completed during my internship at CODSOFT. Each project is aimed at solving practical problems using machine learning techniques.
Details of files that are present in the Repository
1. *Credit Card Fraud Detection:*
   - Developed a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
   - Used a dataset containing information about credit card transactions
   - Practised and experimented with algorithms like LogisticRegression,DecisionTrees to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate
   - Utilized supervised learning techniques to identify anomalies in transaction patterns.
   
2. *Customer Churn Prediction:*
   - Developed a model to predict customer churn for a subsription-based service.
   - Used historical customer data,including features like usage behaviour and customer data
   - Tried algorithms like LogisticRegression,RandomForests to predict churn
   - Analyzed customer behavior and historical data to identify factors contributing to churn.
   
3. *Spam SMS Detection:*
   - Built a classifier to differentiate between spam and legitimate SMS messages.
   - Used techniques like TF-IDF and with classifiers like Naive Bayes,Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine to identify spam massages
   - Implemented natural language processing techniques for text classification.
